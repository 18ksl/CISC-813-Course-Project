# CISC 813 Course Project

## Description
This is a repository for the course project development in CISC 813. This project focuses on the development of a fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planner to be used for action selection of a greeter robot within a lab environment. Social robots capable of human-robot interaction (HRI) have increased in popularity motivating the development of this planner. FOND was selected as it can account for unknown information within the environment (i.e, visitor intention, staff availability, etc.) through its non-deterministic actions. The planner contains two action types: social actions to facilitate social interaction between the visitor-robot pair and physical actions to facilitate the robotâ€™s interaction with the environment. This planner will facilitate the autonomous behaviour of our social robot within the lab environment.
